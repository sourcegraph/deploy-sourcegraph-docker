  # Description: Acts as a reverse proxy for all of the sourcegraph-frontend instances
  #
  # Disk: 1GB / persistent SSD
  # Ports exposed to other Sourcegraph services: none
  # Ports exposed to the public internet: 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
  #
  # Sourcegraph ships with a few builtin templates that cover common HTTP/HTTPS configurations:
  # - HTTP only (default)
  # - HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
  # - HTTPS with custom certificates
  #
  # Follow the directions in the comments below to swap between these configurations.
  #
  # If none of these built-in configurations suit your needs, then you can create your own Caddyfile, see:
  # https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile
