# Serves Sourcegraph over HTTPS, using Caddy's automatic HTTPS certificate feature:
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https
# 
# Note: This configuration uses Let's Encrypt's staging environment. This will 
# allow you to ensure that everything is correctly configured (with a reduced 
# chance of running into rate limit issues). Note that using this configuration
# issues a fake certificate (for testing purposes) instead of a trusted one.
#
# ðŸš¨ Warning: If your DNS and Caddy configuration aren't properly configured (as 
#             specified in https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https), you can 
#             run into Let's Encrypt rate limits which can block your certificates 
#             for up to a week. 
#             It's strongly recommened that you use this Caddyfile to test your
#             configuration before switching to the production one.
