# ðŸš¨ Warning: If your DNS and Caddy configuration aren't properly configured (as
#             specified in https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https), you can
#             run into Let's Encrypt rate limits which can block your certificates
#             for up to a week.
#             It's strongly recommened that you use the staging Caddyfile
#             (https.lets-encrypt-staging.Caddyfile) to test your
#             configuration before switching to this production one.
